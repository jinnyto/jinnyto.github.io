Hi! I'm Jinny.

I currently work full-time on Data Viz at L'Oréal. All views here are my own.

## Interest

The kind of data viz that I'm interested in have the following characteristics:
- Shows what's happening in real life
- Helps the user make an informed decision about a situation based on data
- Powered by live data that is regularly updated
- Displayed through interactive digital interfaces (web applications, websites, Business Intelligence tools, etc...)
- Used by large groups of people who are each at highly varying levels of familiarity with data and tech

As opposed to the following other types of data viz:
- Scientific data viz, which are for exploratory purposes often based on static data
- Data journalism, which are for narrative purposes with pre-defined conclusions and data

For now the kind of data viz I am interested in are referred to as dashboards, though I'm not completely sure it's the best term for this. If you know of a more precise term, please let me know :)

## Ideal

I would like this kind of data viz, such as dashboards, to do the following:
- Show data accurately
- Be easy to understand and interact with
- Spark curiosity and questions
- Help make informed decisions


I'm mostly interested in understanding how data viz and dashboards powered by live data and shared with thousands of people can be designed so that they're practical, easy to understand, and easy to use. If they end up looking nice, that would be a plus, but it's not my primary concern.

Ideally, they would strike the perfect balance between accessibility (easy for everyone to use, regardless of familiarity with data or tech)

- Share references that I appreciate and learned from so I can go back to them later as a personal resource
- If anything I put here can help others, that would be great!
